# Cryptography I

This repo provides solutions for programming assignments from [Cryptography I](https://class.coursera.org/crypto/) course by Dan Boneh (Stanford University).

*Although programming assignments are optional, if you are currently enrolled in the course, you definitely __should not__ browse the code for PA's which you have not completed yet.*
